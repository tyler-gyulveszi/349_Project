    <section id="About Myself">
        <p>Enough about the brand, please let me introuduce myself in further deatil. Again, my name is Tyler Gyulveszi, and I am the owner
            of this magnificient brand where we are building a community of food connoisseurs. I am a Computer Science student at Michigan
            State University, where for the past 4 years I have gotten to broaden my knowledge of programming and the way that the web works. 
            <p><img src="code_example.jpg" alt="code_example" class="code_example"></p>
            Some of the skills I have learned over the past four years include:
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>mySql</li>
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>XML</li>
                <li>A little bit of Linux</li>
                <li>A tiny amount of JavaScipt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <p class="2nd_parag">I know what you're thinking, why should we follow directions from some novice who enjoys cooking as a passtime? Well, cooking has
            meant a lot to me for quite some time. My first memories of me in a kitchen were when I was 4 or 5 years old cooking with my mom, 
            she just loved having an extra pair of hands. As I got older I started to challenge myself more and more to make more delicious
            and challenging foods, constantly making family and friends try my cooking. As time went on I realized that I truly loved being in
            the kitchen, it was a theraputic safe place where I could stowe away for hours on end. I wanted everyone to be able to experience 
            the same joy I feel, and I realized everyone doesn't have the luxuries of having someone to show them how to cook. I decided to 
            use my programming skills to give back to those who are looking to experience a good, home cooked meal. I hope I do an okay job!</p>

            <p>Here are some pictures of my loving family. My mom and dad have supported me all my life, and I am very greatful.
                They have been a big reason that I started cooking in the first place, so it's only right to attribute the success of Chef.IT to them as well. Thanks mom and dad!
            </p>
